# Data Analysis Projets
Here I want to show my experiences of projects done in the past in the field of 'Data Analysis' as well as basic in 'Machine Learning'.
Primarly I show here **jupiter-notebooks**, nevertheless I will perhaps share projects with additional tools I use:
- Python
- Tableau
- Excel
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks


## [BTC and Share Price Analysis]
Exploratory Analysis of the BTC-prices and comparison vs. MSCI All Countries World Index as well German DAX vs MSCI AWCI. 
Data downloaded at Yahoo Finance.
Tools used in course of the project:
- Tableau
